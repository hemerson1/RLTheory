# ML from Scratch

This repo features a small collection of deep machine learning algorithms implemented from first principle. 
The implementations were created using exclusively NumPy and pandas and were done so with reference to the resource:
https://www.deeplearningbook.org/

## Description

The repo includes the following algorithms: 
* **Binary Logistic Regression** - a deep neural neural network using sigmoidal hidden functions and logistic cost function to predict survival in the Titanic dataset. 
* **Dropout vs Bagging** - a comparison of the regularisation techniques: bagging and dropout in their ability to improve model binary logistic regression performance on the Titanic dataset. 
* **Multinomial Logistic Regression** - a deep neural network using ReLU activation hidden functions, a softmax output and logistic cost function to classify petal species in the Iris dataset.
