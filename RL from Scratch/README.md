# RL from Scratch

This repo features a small collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from first principle.
The implementations were created using exclusively NumPy and pandas and were done so with reference to the resource:

## Description

The repo includes the following algorithms: 
* **Value Iteration** - learns the transition function for the open-ai gym environment frozen-lake and uses this to calculate the optimal value function. 

Links to the datasets are included below:
